Sending emails through third party software included in sofware packages is very cumbersome from a configuration perspective. Things can become messy very easily. After struggling with configuring a smtp based mail client to send emails, I developed a mailsender client program that can send emails to an exchange server by leveraging the web service exposed by the exchange. This program is very simple to use and is very easily configurable.

Please use the App configuration file included in the package for initial setup. Please note that this tool is a client just for testing purposes and not for production use.

`@Usage: MailSender.exe <RecipientMail@domain.com> <Subject> <Message content>`
